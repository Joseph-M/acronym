A library of government acronyms.   
  
A first pass at a list of agency acronyms is [here](https://github.com/unitedstates/acronym/blob/gh-pages/_data/agencies.yml), with the resulting json [here](http://theunitedstates.io/acronym/agencies.json).  

Then, there's a very early start to a list of system acronyms [here](https://github.com/unitedstates/acronym/blob/gh-pages/_data/systems.yml), with the resulting json [here](http://theunitedstates.io/acronym/systems.json).  

Other ideas include a list of program and system acronyms.
